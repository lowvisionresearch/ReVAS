# To-do list

* Re-reference module input handling (image vs mat file) 
* add the option of skipping some frames during ref frame making stages (e.g., use only every other frame or every nth frame). Important for long videos.
* use position estimates from make ref stages during strip analysisâ€™s initial search window
* update tutorial for each module (especially for Re-referencing and new modules) and all relevant settings 
* make the initial size of the main GUI larger.. it's too small and the text is not legible on a Mac. 
* make the text on GUI fixed size, OR increase the minimum font size 
* scripting examples? i.e., how to use ReVAS as a library. 
* making a ref frame from a bunch of videos OR combining refs from videos to make a better ref 
* color scheme, make it simpler, cleaner. avoid lots of colors. 
* check for an update at launch and let the user know if there is a newer version 
* check for color channels..
* Make FOV adjustable 
* Check if Re-referencing works without strip analysis
