# To-do list

* Re-reference module input handling (image vs mat file) 
* update tutorial for each module and all relevant settings 
* make the initial size of the main GUI larger.. it's too small and the text is not legible on a Mac. 
* make the text on GUI fixed size, OR increase the minimum font size 
* scripting examples?  
* making a ref frame from a bunch of videos OR combining refs from videos to make a better ref 
* color scheme, make it simpler, cleaner. avoid lots of colors. 
* check for an update at launch and let the user know if there is a newer version 
*
