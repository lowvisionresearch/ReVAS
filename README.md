# ReVAS 0.3.2  

Retinal Video Analysis Suite: a utility for generating reference frames and extracting eye position traces from retinal videos recorded via scanning laser ophthalmoscopes. It also includes a set of tools for classifying eye movements into drifts and (micro)saccades, and extracting detailed information about these eye movements.

Software requirements (to run from source code): 
Matlab, Image Processing Toolbox, Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox, Computer Vision Systems Toolbox, Parallel Computing Toolbox.

Software requirements (to run as a standalone application):
Matlab Run-time library (free to use and automatically downloaded by the installer). 

[Here](/documentation/revastutorial.pdf) is a brief tutorial demonstrating the basic workflow.
